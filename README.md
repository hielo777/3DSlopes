# Construct 3: 3D Slopes in any angle

This project improves on the 3d slopes example found at:

By WackyToaster

That project used the 3D object, with the wedge shape, to allow other 3d objects to go up and down slopes.

The main problem with that approach, as that the angle of the slopes had to be set in multiples of 90° (90°, 180°, 270°, 360°) to work properly.

With this simple sample, the wedges can be set at any angle and will work properly.
